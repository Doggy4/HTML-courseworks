# Sequences of numbers Regex
Sequences of numbers can be found with a simple regex / \ d + /.

Write an expression that only matches JavaScript-style numbers. It should support a possible minus or plus before a number, a decimal point, and exponential notation 5e-3 or 1E10 - again with possible plus or minus. Also note that numbers do not have to be before or after a dot, but a number cannot consist of a single dot. That is, .5 or 5. are valid numbers, but one dot itself is not.
