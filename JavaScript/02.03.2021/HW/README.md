# jQuery Selectors
jQuery selectors practise work.

## Details
Perform using jQuery selectors:
- All HTML elements are strong and color them green
- Find all the em HTML elements and add the .selected class to them
- Find all the mark elements that are in the div with class row and give them the class .selected
- Find all hyperlinks and remove underlines from them
- Find all HTML elements that contain the word "Tasks" and are in an element with the class .container
- Switch the elements strong with the class some to the state without this class, and for those elements (strong) that did not have this class, add.
- Among the set of elements with the class .row, remove the class from the second element
- Read the CSS color property of the second hyperlink in the text
