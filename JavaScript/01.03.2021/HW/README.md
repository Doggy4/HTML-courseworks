# Bookmark interface
Implement a simple bookmark interface. 

## Details
Write a function asTabs that takes a DOM node and creates a tabbed interface by showing the children of that node. It needs to insert a list of `<button>` elements at the top of the node, one for each child element that contains the text retrieved from the data-tabname attribute. All but one of the child elements must be hidden (using display style none), and the currently visible node can be selected by clicking the button.
