# Bulls and Cows Game
Implement the game "Bulls and Cows".
The computer guesses a number from 1000 to 9999, and the person tries to guess it.
The computer reports in response how many digits are guessed without coinciding with their positions in the secret number (that is, the number of cows) and how many guessed up to the position in the secret number (that is, the number of bulls).

# Example
The secret number <3219> is conceived.


Attempt:
```
> 2310
```


Result: 
```
> 2 "cows" (two numbers: "2" and "3" - guessed at the wrong positions)
> 1 “bull” (one number “1” is guessed right up to the position).
```
