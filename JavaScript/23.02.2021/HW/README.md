# Parking System
Create a page to visualize parking operations.
- In the upper left part of the page, there is a form for entering the car number and the owner's surname;
- A schematic representation of the car is displayed at the top right;
- At the bottom there is a parking scheme.

## Work algorithm
1. The parking lot manager enters the car number and the owner's surname;
2. The car number appears on the car image;
3. The user drags the car image to a free place on the parking scheme;
4. If the place is already taken, the drag is canceled;
5. The position to which the car is transfered is designed as occupied and the number of the car is displayed on it.
